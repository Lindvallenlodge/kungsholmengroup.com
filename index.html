        <h2>About Us</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        We are a traveling family living in Stockholm — and we know what it’s like to explore a new city with kids. That’s why we created Strollby Stockholm — to make family travel lighter, easier, and more fun. 
        <br><br>
        Our values are simple: Clean and modern equipment. Reliable delivery and pickup. Personal care. 
        <br><br>
        Because traveling families deserve peace of mind.
